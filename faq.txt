Q: Can I downgrade Roblox or use any glitches with Wave to run it with an unpatched version without getting banned?

A: No. Any administrator can confirm that there is a high chance that your account and other Roblox accounts will be banned (for multi-accounting).


Q: Is this site from the official Wave developer?

A: No, this site was created by Mefisto to track the status of Wave versions.


Q: What if I already purchased a Wave subscription or it recently expired while Wave was down?

A: All days while Wave was down will be compensated for all active subscriptions, as is customary for Wave developers.


You can clarify all other questions in the Wave Discord(https://discord.getwave.gg/) server chat or in the chat on the website above.
